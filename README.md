# Note Taker - An Express Application

This application lets users write, save, recall, and delete notes.

## Motivation

This application reflects a simple yet effective example of test-driven development, along with use of [ES6 Classes and Subclasses](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/07/es6-in-depth-classes/), HTML generation, regular expressions, switch statements, and more. My goal this week was to continue to utilize as much ES6 as possible throughout the application.

## Installation and Usage

The deployed application can be found at: [Note Taker](#).

If interested in running the app locally or deploying your own version, clone or fork the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com/nabeek/note-taker). For local versions run `npm install` and then start the server with `node server.js`. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ or the port of your choosing if editing the server.js file.
